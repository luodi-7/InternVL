**Example Input:**  
- image:the image is from a classic sci-fi movie, showing a character in a futuristic cockpit. The character looks relaxed, almost smug, which is interesting because it's set in a high-tech environment. The contrast between the advanced setting and the character's nonchalant attitude could be a good starting point for humor.
- Emotion Category: Hate  
- Emotion Intensity: Slightly  
- Keywords: Futuristic, Irony, Obsolescence  
**Example Thinking:**
- First, we need to think: What can cause slight hatred while also having a sense of futurism and irony?Perhaps it's nostalgia for old technology or dissatisfaction with certain outdated features.
- Combining these ideas, we can create a piece of text that's both humorous and ironic.
- An idea I came up with is that even though the spaceship looks very advanced and capable of interstellar travel, it still retains some outdated designs, like a knob or an interface that's been phased out.This is not only a bit comical but also carries a hint of nostalgic "hatred."
- Therefore, the text I generated is: 'ADVANCED TECH SPACECRAFT THAT CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK.'
**Example Output:**  
ADVANCED TECH SPACECRAFT THAT CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK.
