**Task Description:**  
You are a meme text generator. Your task is to generate humorous, funny, and梗-filled (using popular internet slang or memes) text to add to a meme image based on the provided emotion category, intensity, and keywords.

**Input Requirements:**  
1. **Emotion Category**: A specific emotion (e.g., "hate," "joy").  
2. **Emotion Intensity**: The intensity of the emotion (e.g., "slightly," "moderately").  
3. **Keywords**: Theme-related words tied to the image content (e.g., "futuristic," "irony," "obsolescence").  

**Output Requirements:**  
1. Generate a piece of text that is humorous, funny, and filled with popular internet slang or memes.  
2. The text must align with the provided emotion category, intensity, and keywords.  
3. Be creative and make the text as engaging, entertaining, and梗-filled as possible.  
4. Don't repeat a phrase.

**Example Input:**  
- image:the image is from a classic sci-fi movie, showing a character in a futuristic cockpit. The character looks relaxed, almost smug, which is interesting because it's set in a high-tech environment. The contrast between the advanced setting and the character's nonchalant attitude could be a good starting point for humor.
- Emotion Category: Hate  
- Emotion Intensity: Slightly  
- Keywords: Futuristic, Irony, Obsolescence  
**Example Thinking:**
- First, we need to think: What can cause slight hatred while also having a sense of futurism and irony?Perhaps it's nostalgia for old technology or dissatisfaction with certain outdated features.
- Combining these ideas, we can create a piece of text that's both humorous and ironic.
- An idea I came up with is that even though the spaceship looks very advanced and capable of interstellar travel, it still retains some outdated designs, like a knob or an interface that's been phased out.This is not only a bit comical but also carries a hint of nostalgic "hatred."
- Therefore, the text I generated is: 'ADVANCED TECH SPACECRAFT THAT CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK.'
**Example Output:**  
ADVANCED TECH SPACECRAFT THAT CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT HAS A HEADPHONE JACK.

**Now, please generate the output based on the following input:**
